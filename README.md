# Equation
A fast way to dynamically process large, regular datasets.

## Planned Features
 * Enhanced multithreading support
 * More mathematical functions (log, gamma, erf, etc...)

## Cool Applications
While not required, if you use equations in a cool project, it would be nice to know how the software is used.

Applications:
 * Satellite imagery analysis
